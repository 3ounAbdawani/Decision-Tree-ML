# Decision Tree Machine Learning Project

## 🧠 Overview
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a **Decision Tree model** using Python. The notebook `decision_tree_ml.ipynb` walks through each step of the process — from data loading and preprocessing to model training and performance evaluation.

## 📊 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature selection and encoding  
- Training a Decision Tree classifier  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualization  
- Insights and interpretation of the tree structure  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib / seaborn

## 📁 Files
decision_tree_ml.ipynb — main notebook containing the full implementation.

requirements.txt — list of Python packages (to be created if not included).

## 📈 Results
The model achieves strong predictive performance, showing how Decision Trees can effectively classify data with clear interpretability. Visualizations help explain the model’s logic and decision paths.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files.  
2. Install the required dependencies:
